**Product Name:** Teamify

**Far Vision:** Facilitating the creation of the right team at the right time

**Near Vision:** A tool for students to self-organize into effective agile teams

Today, when course instructors\
Want to allow students to form their own teams\
They have to let students figure out the team-formation process as well as their teams\
This is unacceptable, because ad hoc processes are opaque, slow, and may result in unbalanced teams, resulting in student anxiety and suboptimal team products\
We envision a world where team building is balanced, easy, fast, and transparent\
We’re bringing this world about through an online app to manage the team formation process.

**Product Backlog:** https://trello.com/b/i3THeXFj/teamify2020  

**Backlog ordering rationale:**      
The backlog is composed of items from two types of stakeholders: 1) the Instructor, and 2) the students (CSCI S-71 2020).  Since the students are internal stakeholders, the priorities of our external real stakeholder (Instructor) were given higher consderation.  The initial ordering includes the top items from the Instructor persona, whose items were ordered independently during the first interview.  His priorities were based on ensuring no student was "left-behind" without a team or no understandable way to join a team.  The top items from the Student persona were developed and ordered internally based on what students found most difficult and opaque in forming Agile teams as well as difficulties with communicating skills and experiences in a standardized way to form diverse teams.  The top priorties from both personas are intermixed for tool development timeline dependencies and value decisions to balance the needs of both personas.  The minimum conceptual requirements for the product were captured without early focus on implementation details.  It is expected that during sprint planning, each of the Product Backlog items will be expanded into multiple work items, capturing more specific implementation details.
