**Product Name:** Teamify

**Far Vision:** Facilitating the creation of the right team at the right time

**Near Vision:** A tool for students to self-organize into effective agile teams

Today, when course instructors\
Want to allow students to form their own teams\
They have to let students figure out the team-formation process as well as their teams\
This is unacceptable, because ad hoc processes are opaque, slow, and may result in unbalanced teams, resulting in student anxiety and suboptimal team products\
We envision a world where team building is balanced, easy, fast, and transparent\
We’re bringing this world about through an online app to manage the team formation process.

**Stakeholder Types:**  
Agile course students  
Agile course instructors  
Developer in an Agile organization\
Line manager in an Agile organization

**User Persona for Richard Kasperowski (real person):**  
Name:  Richard  
Role:  Agile Course Instructor  
Age:  50  
Gender: Male  
Skill level 1:  Professional Agile trainer, coach, and course Instructor  
Skill level 2:  Professional Agile software development team facilitator  
Skill level 3:  Author of Agile topics  
Motivation:  Provide students a welcoming, unintimidating and easy-to-use means to share details about themselves and self-organize into teams that I can reference as a single source for student and team information.  
Frustrations:  Using Slack as a team formation tool is not user friendly for both Instructors and students.  Students come to me with questions where answers could be provided upfront in the course.  Also, it's difficult to discover who has _not_ been active or able to find a team.  
Desires/wants/needs: Make it super-easy for students to form teams for group projects. Make sure no students are left behind. Also wants to encourage diversity of skills within each team.

**Product Backlog:** https://trello.com/b/i3THeXFj/teamify2020  

**Backlog ordering rationale:**

The backlog is composed of items suggested by two types of stakeholders: 1) the Instructor, and 2) the students (CSCI S-71 2020).  The real students in this case were the members of the Scrum team, and the instructor was the real instructor of Harvard's CSCI S-71 course.  We opted to weigh the instructor's priorities more than the students' due to his experience of watching teams form many times (each time he has offered the course) as well as to temper our own biases in our dual roles as developers and students.

The instructor's top PBI goals seemed to focus on ensuring no student was left behind without a team and no understandable way to join a team.  On the other hand, our top PBI goals were focused on making the team formation process more transparent and removing barriers to the communication of skills and experiences so that diverse teams could form.  In the end, to balance the needs of both personas, we interleaved these top priorities, starting with the instructor's, while trying to maintain a product backlog order in which lower priority backlog items only depended upon higher priority backlog items.

The minimum viable requirements for the product were captured without early focus on implementation details.  We expect that during sprint planning, each of the Product Backlog Items will be expanded into multiple work items as the backlog is groomed, we consider more specific implementation details, and we learn more about our product together with our stakeholders.

**Definition of Done:**      
- All acceptance criteria are resolved  
- Work has been peer reviewed and all issues addressed  
- Work is commited to repository   
- Work has been independently tested from the repository and is bug free   
- PO has accepted the story     

**Definition of Ready:**      
- PBI has a user story Title   
- PBI has a user story Description (opening sentence)   
- Any conjunctions in description have been examined for further refinement   
- The INVEST mnemonic has been considered for the PBI   
- At least one Acceptance Criteria is defined   
- Additional details are captured (implementation requirements and/or options)  
- PBI is estimated in story points relative to other PBI's   
- PBI is centrally stored in Trello board with other PBI's   
- PBI has been priortized by the PO  
- Development team has accepted the PBI

**Estimating activity:**  Affinity estimating  

All members of our team, including the Scrum Master and Product Owner, are also doubling as development team members.  Therefore all members of the team participated in our affinity estimating activity.

We followed the procedure outlined in the article [Affinity Estimating: A How-To](http://www.gettingagile.com/2008/07/04/affinity-estimating-a-how-to/) by Chris Sterling.  First, all PBIs were placed as stickies on a [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kqfm64Y=/).  Each team member took one color of sticky note, and we ordered them silently from left to right, smallest to largest.  After that, we had a group discussion in which we collaboratively adjusted items, talking through each PBI where some team member found it in an unexpected order.  Finally, we identified natural groupings.  In two instances where a PBI fell between two groupings, we opted to include the PBI in the larger grouping, since we may not be able to deliver that item in the same amount of effort as PBIs in the smaller grouping.  We assigned each grouping a story point value from the Fibonacci sequence and updated our product backlog accordingly (putting the point value in parentheses before each PBI title in Trello).

As we get more experience with our chosen tech stack and as a team, we expect that our estimates will get better, so we consider these estimates provisional.  They will be updated during sprint planning or backlog grooming as necessary.
