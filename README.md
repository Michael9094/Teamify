**Product Backlog:** https://trello.com/b/i3THeXFj/teamify2020

**Backlog ordering rationale:**      
The backlog is ordered based primarily on Student Persona experiences in forming Agile teams during CSCI S-71 2020 and are prioritized by expected value.  A primary focus was on what students found most difficult and opaque when creating groups.  One main difficulty was communicating skills and experiences in a standardized way to form diverse teams, so that formed the top items on our initial backlog.  This dovetailed with the professor’s observations that the most successful teams in past courses had been diverse.  The minimum conceptual requirements for the product were captured without early focus on implementation details.   Acceptance criteria will be expanded once our Primary Instructor customer is interviewed, which may result in reordering or refinement.  It is expected that during sprint planning, each of the Product Backlog items will be expanded into multiple work items, capturing more specific implementation details.
